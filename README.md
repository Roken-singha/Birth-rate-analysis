# Births Analysis Project
### Overview
This project analyzes birth data from a CSV file (births.csv) using Python. It includes data cleaning, grouping by year, and visualization of total births over time.
## Requirements

Python 3.x
pandas
matplotlib

## Install dependencies using:
pip install pandas matplotlib

## Usage

Ensure births.csv is in the project directory (or update the file path in the code).
Run the Jupyter Notebook births_analysis.ipynb:
Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
Start Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook.
Open births_analysis.ipynb and run all cells.


## The script will:
Clean the data (remove missing values, convert day to integer).
Calculate total births and unique years.
Generate a plot of total births per year saved as births_per_year.png.



## Files

births_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code and output.
births.csv: Input dataset with birth records (columns: year, births, day, etc.).


## Output

Text Output: Displays total births, number of unique years, and a list of years.
Plot: A line graph titled "Total Births per Year" with year on the x-axis and number of births on the y-axis.

## Notes

Last updated: May 16, 2025
Ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed and configured with a dark theme for best visualization (e.g., jt -t onedark).
